        Steps to make it:
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Liquid: In a medium pot, bring 1 cup of water or broth to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and olive oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Couscous: Once the liquid is boiling, remove the pot from heat. Stir in the couscous, then cover and let it sit for about 5 minutes to absorb the liquid.</li>
        <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>Fluff and Serve: After 5 minutes, use a fork to fluff the couscous, breaking up any clumps. You can add more olive oil, butter, or seasonings at this point for extra flavor. Serve it as a side dish or with stews, grilled meats, or vegetables.</li>
